<p>The year was 1995, the night was June 13th. Curtis and Patricia Martin were celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary, and little did they know nine months later they were going to have a "Happy Little Accident" and end up a third child. And I've been just as lucky ever since!
    My luck was ever so present in the first grade when six cases of tonsilitus left me hospitalized. Oh! And that time I was bit by a shark! I continue to press my luck today by trying to learn code in just three short months.
    Now don't get me wrong, I haven't always been able to rely on so-called "Lady Luck". She wasn't there for me when I won the state championship backstroke race when I was twelve. Nor was she there for me when I graduated high school three months early with honors. And ESPECIALLY not when I need her most, that fateful night last August when I stayed up all night to beat my Castlevania IV high score.</p>
